And just like that : PUFF! Not swisscamp packed and the last nobody evaporated leaving nothing but a pair of shoes.
Lube shortage at Come&Play. All workshops are changed to include "rough desert sandplay".
Uninvited guests are hanging out around the exit of Sarinena. Tell your friends on their way to Nowhere and you’re welcome 😉
The quality of cabins is also clearly deteriorating. Just another example of cutting corners. 
Rumor has it Glitch is using the money to stuff their pockets and pay for horrendously expensive chakra realignment from Here and Now after an orgy gone wrong left them with a twisted root chakra.
Essential Nowhere infrastructure has gone missing during the storm. Suspicious posts have been circulating in exclusive nowhere secretive groups. Here we believe in transparency, so we're willing to endanger our snitches to let YOU know this is how your Barrio Support Money is being spent!
Weather forecast for this year's Nowhere is in!
Nowhere is fast approaching and some brave & hot builders are already on site preparing all necessary infrastructure : look at them go! 🤘🔥😎
Missing Nowhere and feeling the blues? Don't worry, someone made a playlist with all the best hits you've heard this week in the field of dirt. Enjoy!

Camp signs have gone missing during the night. If any are found, please return them to the wrong camp.

Orgy for beginners has been cancelled due to lack of rainproofing in the curious creatures playspace. The orgy has been postponed to the middle of nowhere, tomorrow night at 8.

Welcome to Nowhere! Here's a bunch of things you don't need to know.

Playspace bingo : first team to have sex in all 8 playspaces can go to the middle of nowhere, pick up the Voice of God megaphone and shout BINGO! it will be broadcast all over Nowhere 🔥
Check out the latest selection of costume camp outfits, borrow what you like but remember to bring them back before the end of the week.
Sweaty dusty is the new sexy 😉
Acqua Gallo **exposed** on the Nowhere group 🫣 Those "corporate cocks" had it coming!! 
The freecampers have united to stage a protest, making signs on Tuesday and protesting on Thursday from the Middle of Fucking Nowhere (pictures and location attached).
Rumor has it that this started because Acqua Gallo offered real money to sponsor the free campers water project, but they said no because "no sponsors". Make a stand this week at Nowhere! Say no to corporate cocks!!


Got any hot gossip, ridiculously bad images, stories of great failures and anything else that you think may fit for a broadcast here? Send those to Freddy in one tap: https://t.me/freddyfiasco

The absurdity is the point 👀
Some burners didnt show up and left a delivery on the playa. If anyone wants to buy it send Waldo a message.
💦 Sate your thirst at Nowhere with Acqua Gallo 💦 
 
Say no to filthy, green water from the watercubes. 🛢️ Say yes to natural mineral cock water from Nowhere's **official** beverage partner. 🐓

Acqua Gallo is naturally crafted, with a perfectly smooth taste, cocked and bottled locally in the Monegros dustlands… Find it only at the finest barrios of Nowhere.

Taste the difference at Nowhere 🧭 per il vostro felicitá.
Thankfully, filthy green water is not the only water you can drink at Nowhere.
Watch this **NSFW** 🔞 video to see how the controversial Acqua Gallo is made.
As one Italian put it: "no thanks, I'd rather die thirsty" 💦
A few days ago one of the unlabeled watercubes on site got accidentally filled with 1000L of diesel 🙈 It got dealt with and moved to its appropriate location next to the generators.

Now actual water came through, and this is a picture of it - is it water though? Or is it diesel? 😅

Spin the wheel this Nowhere - you never know what you may be drinking! 💦
Fly traps are worthless this year!

One of the hottest commodities on the Playa last Nowhere is now worth nothing, as the neighbouring farmer who last year spread manure on the field next to Nowhere "has been dealt with". 

Keep up to date with the latest financial news and investment opportunities - only on Nowhere NUDES! 🔥😎
Don’t trust official NORG channels. They are a cabal of radical nepotits, intent on controlling the nowhere narrative, and caring only for the many. 

Trust NUDES. We care for you, select few, and will always tell you where to poop when all toilets are full! 💩
The Hippie Soup is back!

Keeping us all fresh & “clean” this Nowhere! 

Don’t forget to bring your own chlorine 💦 Wash thoroughly before & **after** 💦 No diving, no sipping, but plenty of dipping
THE POST NOWHERE DOESN’T WANT YOU TO SEE

What is this mysterious video that appeared and disappeared overnight on the Nowhere / Euroburners group? 

A scam? A controversial art project? An actual sponsor? 🤔 

We don’t know - but if the admins don’t want you to see it, we want you to see it. Keep up with all the drama here! Only on Nowhere NUDES. 😉
Final Call for DJs and sound healers for Übertown Meditation Center. 

They are particularly looking for Organic, plant-based music, but are also very open-minded to anything vibrational. 

Email Josh@goingnowhere.org with mixes, etc. if keen! 

Love & Light






Some of the highlights from last year’s channel. Yes, we do occasionally post **consensual** nudes too! They usually involve power tools / digging / extremely hot and dehydrated nobodies. 💋🌝💫🔥

Welcome to 🔥 Nowhere Unofficial Disinformation Entertainment Server 🔥  ( NUDES Department )

Expect nothing useful, disappointment, and a waste of your time. 🙈

What's that sound coming out of Bread & Tomato? It's Pachanga Boys, Time. 

__You will know what you don't need to know, when you need to know what you don't need to know. __
