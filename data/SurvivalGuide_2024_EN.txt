THE FIRST THING:
NOWHERE IS A RADICALLY  
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE  
FROM WHAT YOU ALREADY  
KNOW.
You are Nowhere. 
You build the bar r ios, the art
and the ‚artomobiles.™  
Unlike other fes ti vals, at Nowhere we are 
in ten tionally self- organising– you™re the 
perfor merŠa nd the audience . T here™s n o 
‚ them™Šthere™s jus t us, and we™re all in it 
toge ther.
N owhere is a Burning Ma n regional even t
in Spain, an exper im en t in creati ve freedom, 
participation and cash-free community.
ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND:  
YOU DON™T ATTEND
NOWHERE.
YOU CREATE IT.
WH AT  IS
NOWHERE?
This is your Nowhere S urvival Gui de. 
It™s a gu ide packed with im portant 
inf o rmatio n about w ha t to e xpect, 
what you ™ll need to get the most out of 
the experience and, of course, ho w to 
actually get to No where.
We recom mend p rinting the 
document and b ringing it w ith you 
to Nowhere.If you purchased tickets

COOPERATION
TOGETHER 
WE ARE S TRONGER. 
Co-operation is at Nowhere™s 
co re, fro m how we w ork 
together to ho w we 
co m municate. I f we can make 
life easier fo r each other, 
we will. If we can make life 
better fo r each other, we will. 
Together, we are stronger.
LEAVE NO TRACE
FROM DUST TO DUST, 
WE LEAVE ONLY 
FOOTPRINTS. 
Ev erything y ou bring to the 
desert has the potential to 
become ﬁ MOOPﬂ (Matter 
Out Of Place). Ev ery person 
is responsible for their own 
rubbish.We care for the 
enviro nment, and we take 
care of our home. We cle an 
up after ourselv es, we leav e 
nothing behind which means 
we leav e no trace or an y 
indicatio n tha t we were there.
SELF RELIANCE
YOU ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR 
YOU, MEN TALLY AND 
PHYSICALLY. 
Fro m fo od and wa ter to 
a hug or quiet s pace, you 
need to take care o f yourself 
in N owhere™s challenging 
enviro nment. Giv e yourself 
what you needŠand ask 
others for help when you 
need it.
PAR TICIPATION
GET INVOLVED 
Œ
 NOWHERE 
I S WHAT WE MAKE IT. 
The mo re you do, the more 
you get back. When you join 
others in play and in wo rk, 
you beco me part of Nowhere. 
Your co ntributio n is more 
valuable than you realise.
GIFTING
WE GIVE OUR TIME, 
EFFORT AND GIFTS FREELY.
We giv e to help others and 
because it makes us feel 
good. From sharing a cold 
beer to digging out a tent 
pole to giving a small badge, 
our gifts co me from our 
heart.
IMMEDIACY
MAKE NOW COUN T. 
Be no w here, be no where. 
Make now count. All t his will 
soo n be go ne, so enjo y n o w. 
Experience, participate, be. 
This is all there is, so enjoy it!
NO COMMERCE
FORGET ABOUT 
MO NEY  
Œ
 THERE™S 
NOTHING TO BUY. 
By removing com merce 
fro m our co m munity, we 
create co operation and 
participa tio n. We plan ahead 
and wo rk together. We live 
without mo ney to rem ind us 
of w hat™s re ally i mportant. 
‚N o co mmerce™ means there 
will be no money circula tio n 
at Nowhere, and, with the 
exception of ice, nothing to 
buy or to sell! 
INCLUSION
 
EVERYONE I S WELCOME TO 
BE  NOBODY.  
We are grateful to ev eryone 
for their unique contribution 
to our com munity. Include 
others as you want to be 
incl uded, with respect, 
consideration and 
benevolence. Remember, it 
takes mo re than tolerance 
−
integra tio n.
COMMUNITY
A FAMILY OF INDIVIDUALS, 
WE LOOK AFTER 
EACH OTHER. 
A diverse group of s eparate 
self-reliant beings, we are 
united in our need to be 
part of so mething larger 
than ourselv es. Co m munity, 
others, selfŠ united by 
tolerance and joy.
SELF
EXPRESSION
THE FREEDOM 
TO BE YOURSELF. 
Be the perso n you a re. Be 
the perso n you want to be. 
We respect and v alue you, 
and expect the same from 
you towards others. Nowhere 
is an opportunity to liv e life 
to the fullest, in a way that 
could be inappropriate in 
the ‚default wo rld ™. H owev er, 
ple ase be ar your f ello w 
participants in mind when

yourself freely, b ut w ith 
respect. A nd remem ber: they

TOILETS
Portable toilets, po rta-

many names for the 
tem porary toilets you 
often see at festivals and 
other ev ents. 
They are fully clo sed 
with four walls and a 
ceiling. These will be 
strategically  placed 
(alongside some urinals) 
to make sure there are 
enough easily accessible 
toilets, including so me 
wheelchair-accessible

 Stay out of the sun fro m 
1-4pm (try a siesta). 
 Use hats, shades, 
sunscreens, wet c lothes, 
and shelters to minimise 
your exposure.
Nowhere takes place 
in the desert, in a v ery  
hot, harsh clima te, with 
none of the amenities of

Inno vation projects help to make No where better in some way. 
Example projects might speed-up the co nstructio n and takedown 
of No where, provide better l ightning, sav e water or electricity, 
 
reusing rubbish.
Inno vation projects do n™t n ecessarily hav e to be participato ry or 
artistic, they c an be ‚behind the scenes™ or purely functio nal.
An y skill o r talent you are willing to share is your gift to the co m munity. 
Whether you d ance, make music, do yoga , sing opera, t wirl nipp le tassels, 
swing poi, medita te, p lay gu itar, paint watercolours or practice tantra , your 
participatio n is encouraged, nay, req u ired!
Co mmunal cam ps (Barrios) are a gre at w ay to pool resources. 
Barrio s often buy co m munal fo o d and wa ter and share the co sts 
between their members.
By wo rking together with a group of like-m inded peop le, you can

Committee members are 
carefully selected from Œ and 
approved by Œ the community, 
and they begin to assess the 
reports starting in November. 
The goal of the Consent 
Committee is NOT to determine 
guilt or innocence, but to define 
with both parties how to protect 
our community from any  
additional reported breach of the 
Participant Code of Conduct and 
ensure the community™s ability to 
hold our events.
ADULT PLAY SPACES AVAILABLE FOR ADULT ACTIVITIES
Fo r numerous re aso n s such as the princip le o f I ncl usion as well a s Spanish law 
which prohibits sex in fro nt of mino rs, sex a nd co n sensual violence are not 
perm itted in spaces tha t are open to ev eryo ne, ev en if no one i s around at tha t 
moment.  Ple ase use your tent or one of the man y ad ult playspaces provided by 
barrios, which are marked on the Playspaces Map availab le at NoInf o.
CONSENT
At No where, we are free 
to e xpress ourselv es, to 
share, to co- cre ate, to 
be in the moment: but 
when our actio n s directly 
alter someone else™s 
experience, we need to 
get their consent.
As a co mmunity 
with div erse views, 
backgrounds, and 
co mmunicatio n styles, 
it™s best to use cle ar 
verbal communica tio n 
to make sure ev eryo ne™s 
boundaries are 
understood and 
respected.
Co n sent is a framework 
we can all use to 
engage i n this playful, 
experimental space we 
cre ate together while 
gathering the information 
we need to be mindful of 
our im pact on our f ello w 
co mmunity members.
Co n sent isn™t just about 
sex, it i s about checking 
in bef o re acting on an y 
desire involving others, 
including no n-sexual 
touch, using other 
people™s belongings, 
gifting, and taking 
photographs. 
So–how does one 
beco me a highly 
consensual person?
HERE™S A 
STEP ˚BY˚STEP GUIDE
1. Know the di˜erence  
bet ween what is yo urs  
a n d w hat belongs to  
others.
It seems obvious: my 
body is mine and your 
body is yours. B ut we 
may n ot realize tha t ev en 
casual, playful touching 
that seems no rmal might 
not be received well by 
ev eryo ne. Or we may 
think nobo dy will mind if 
we j ust eat a bit of t heir 
f o od or use so mething 
fro m their cam p without 
asking– the truth is, there 
is no way to be certain 
unless you ask.
2. Ask for w hat yo u wa nt  
from a person w ho is a ble  
to consent.
Communica tio n is a t wo-
way street. Nobo dy kno ws 
what you want better 
than y ou, so you need to 
ask fo r what you want, 
which can be scary when 
there™s a chance they will 
say ‚No.™ If a perso n is 
not able to u nderstand 
what you are a sking or 
express their own desires 
(f o r exam ple i f t hey are 
unconscious, sleeping, or 
too intoxica ted), they can™t 
consent.
3 . Listen to the a nswer.
Do n™t act if t he answer 
is an ything but a cle ar, 
enthusiastic ‚yes™. D on™t 
try to persuade someo ne 
who sai d ‚No™ to change 
their mind, ev en if 
it™s hard to hear. And 
remem ber that silence i s 
not consent.
4. Show gratitude for a ny 
a nswer but especially  
ﬁNoﬂ.
A true maste r of consent  
not only acce pts the  
a nswer, but shows  
gratitude for it. It is easy  
to show gratitude for  
a˛rmative answers, but  
it™s even more importantŠ
and harderŠwhen  
someone s ays ‚No.™
5. Keep checking in.
Once you get an 
enthusiastic ‚Yes ™ and 
proceed, keep checking i n. 
Co n sent to one act do es 
not a uto ma tically giv e you 
consent for other actions. 
And sometimes, the 
perso n you ™re w ith may 
beco me silent or change 
their mind. The goal is 
fo r everyone involved 
to hav e a nice time, so 
keep communicating and 
adj ust ac cordingly as the 
situation evolves.
6. Sta n d up for consent.
Lastly, as masters of 
co n sent, we should always 
be aware of those around 
us. You can and should 
check in o n others, ev en 
strangers if a situation 
seems questio nable.  It™s 
better to v erify than to 
allo w a potentially harmful 
situation to pro ceed, 
and is worth the risk of 
embarrassment.
GIVE ONLY WHAT™S APPRECIATED, 
TAKE ONLY WHAT™S OFFERED.
